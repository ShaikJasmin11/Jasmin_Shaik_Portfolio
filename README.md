## üîß Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14 or above) installed  
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed

### Installation

1. Clone the repo :
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShaikJasmin11/Jasmin_Shaik_Portfolio.git
   cd Jasmin_Shaik_Portfolio
   
2. Install dependencies :
   ```bash
   npm install

3. Create a .env file (recommended) for your email credentials :
   ```bash
   EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password

4. Start the server locally :
   ```bash
   node server.js

5. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000

## Contact Form Setup

The contact form uses Nodemailer with Gmail SMTP to send emails.
You‚Äôll need to create an app password for your Gmail account for this to work securely:

- Go to Google Account Security
- Enable 2-Step Verification
- Generate an app password for ‚ÄúMail‚Äù
- Use this app password in your .env as EMAIL_PASS

## Deployment
This project is deployed on Render.com for free hosting of the Node.js backend and static frontend.

If you want to deploy yourself:

- Create an account on Render
- Connect your GitHub repo
- Configure a Node.js web service pointing to server.js
- Set environment variables for email credentials
- Deploy & enjoy your live portfolio!
